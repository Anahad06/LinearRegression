# LinearRegression
I used Linear Regression/R Sqaured Method to predict a linear equation associated with the dataset comparing the independent variable of Head Size to the dependent of Brain Weight. Furthermore, I used the R Squared Method to determine the accuracy (this was done with the help of a few libraries). This was my first hands on experience with LR and a few libraries like pandas, numpy, etc. 

What is Linear Regression & How is it done? 

'Linear regression is used to predict the relationship between two variables by applying a linear equation to observed data. There are two types of variable, one variable is called an independent variable, and the other is a dependent variable. Linear regression is commonly used for predictive analysis. Defined by the formula y = c + b*x' (Taken from vedantu). 

c = constant 
b = regression coefficient
x = indep var 
y = dep var 

It is typically done with the Least Square method which determines a line of best fit based on the data given. 

What is the R Squared Method? 

"It indicates the level of variation in the given data set. The coefficient of determination is the square of the correlation (r), thus it ranges from 0 to 1." (byjus). 

How is it calculated? 

r = n (∑xy) – ∑x ∑y / √ [n* (∑x2 – (∑x)2)] * [n* (∑y2 – (∑y)2)]

It appears vastly complicated but it is not with the help of a few libaries. (Namely Sklearn)
