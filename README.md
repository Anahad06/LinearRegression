# LinearRegression
I used Linear Regression/R Sqaured Method to predict a linear equation associated with the dataset comparing the independent variable of Head Size to the dependent of Brain Weight. Furthermore, I used the R Squared Method to determine the accuracy (this was done with the help of a few libraries). This was my first hands on experience with LR and a few libraries like pandas, numpy, etc.
